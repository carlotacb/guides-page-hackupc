## Before the event

<!--
### :briefcase: What to Bring

- **Valid ID** - Make sure to bring your government-issued or student ID. We will need this in order to check you in. You will also need this if you'd like to check out hardware.
- Laptop, Phone, Chargers, and Other Devices - Don't forget to bring your chargers and extra batteries for any device you'll be using.
- Headphones
- Comfortable clothes.
- Towel and toiletry - We will have showers available and encourage you to use them!
- Sleeping bag - If you’re sensitive to cold and plan to sleep, it may be a good option.

We will give out a water bottle, sleeping mask and ear plugs, so you don’t need to bring them with you.
-->

### :round_pushpin: Location

This edition is online, so you can be wherever you want. Remember to stay save!

The digital location will be the Discord server. 
The invite link will be provided on Friday via email, but before joining it, you must link your discord account to MyHackUPC.

<!--
“Edifici A5 del Campus Nord, C/Jordi Girona, 1-3, 08034 Barcelona”

HackUPC will take place in the buildings A3 to A6 of the Campus Nord of the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (Facultat d’Informàtica de Barcelona).

#### Directions

**From the airport:** Take the L9 line of the metro until the last stop, Zona Universitària. From there, it’s a 5-10min walk until the university. The fare for a single ticket from the airport is 4.60€.
Another option is taking the train from the station in terminal T2 until Sants Estació, then taking the L3 line of the metro until Palau Reial. This combination will cost you 4.40€, but requires a transfer and takes more time.

**From the city center:** Take the L3 line of the metro until Palau Reial. From there, it’s a 5-10min walk until the university. The fare for a single ticket is 2.20€.
Other options, depending on where are you coming from, are the tram (lines T1, T2 and T3) or the bus (lines 7, 33, 63 among others). The fare for a single ticket in both cases is also 2.20€.

### :raised_hand: Rules

The #1 rule is “Be respectful”.
Please read [HackUPC’s code of conduct](https://legal.hackersatupc.org/hackupc/code_of_conduct). We require all hackers to abide by these rules.

### :bulb: Hacking

Hacking is only allowed from 9:00 PM on Friday to 9:00 AM on Sunday! You can start planning your project and setting up your work environment (libraries you may use, IDEs you may need…) before that, but no coding.

### :sos: Need help? Mentors!

You may contact them via the #tech-problems channel.

### :trophy: PROJECT SUBMISSIONS

Please submit your projects on our Devpost by Sunday 13th 9:00 PM. Also remember to opt-in for any sponsor prizes that you are eligible for. Submit early, you can edit your submission later!

Our judging will take place expo style. You’ll present your project to the judges and have 3 minutes to demo what you learned and built. You should still demo your project even if you’re not finished, as our main criteria don’t include finishing it.

<!--
### :airplane: Travel Reimbursement

The processing of travel reimbursements takes some time - our schedule depends on our sponsors' schedule. We expect to have them sent out in around a month or two. Also, remember that you must submit a project before the deadline in order to get the reimbursement.
